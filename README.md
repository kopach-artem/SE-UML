# Underground Library Adventure Game


## Overview
This repository hosts the comprehensive documentation and UML diagrams for the Underground Library Adventure Game, a strategic and interactive simulation where players guide monks on a quest to locate the Holy Grail within a sprawling underground library. The project is part of a software engineering course assignment by Artem Kopach, known by Neptun code JQBOLI. The repository includes a **full suite of use cases, class diagrams, and descriptions necessary for understanding and potentially developing the game based on the provided models.**


## Repository Contents
- Documentation (.pdf): Detailed game rules, functionalities, and system requirements.
- WhiteStarUML Files: Diagram files that can be opened with WhiteStarUML software to view the detailed UML diagrams including class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and state machine diagrams.


## Viewing the Documentation
To view the documentation and UML diagrams:

- Microsoft Word Documents: Ensure you have Microsoft Word installed or any compatible word processor that supports .docx files.
- WhiteStarUML Diagrams:
  - Download and install WhiteStarUML from WhiteStarUML Official Website.
  - Open the UML diagram files using WhiteStarUML to view and interact with the diagrams.
 
## Game Description
The game features a complex environment with multiple types of rooms, interactive elements, and dynamic obstacles:

- **Monks** navigate through rooms, collect up to five types of relics including the Holy Grail, and avoid or combat daemons using special relics.
- **Rooms** vary in function and capacity, affecting gameplay with specific traits such as poison, disappearing doors, or daemon transferring capabilities.


## UML Diagrams
The UML diagrams provide a structured visual representation of the systemâ€™s architecture and behavior:

- **Class Diagrams** outline the classes involved in the game along with their attributes and methods.
- **Sequence** Diagrams depict the interactions between objects over time, providing insight into the flow of gameplay and events.
- **State Machine Diagrams** show the states and transitions of game elements, particularly focusing on the lifecycle of monks and game-winning conditions.
